# fys-stk4155
collaboration repos for fys-stk4155, project 2.

Structure:
We have structured the source code, so that files are in subdirectories part2a, part2b. 
This corresponding to the subtasks of project description at
https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/blob/master/doc/Projects/2023/Project2/pdf/Project2.pdf
The report has no references to these as subtasks, this is only in the code structure. 

Reproduce the results of the report:
For subtasks a), and e), simply run each python-script under directories part2a and part2e with no parameter. Command line: python3 <filename.py>
For subtasks b) c) and d) more parameter variants are needed. Refer to README.md file under corresponding subdirectories.
